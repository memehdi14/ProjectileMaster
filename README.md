# ProjectileMaster
Projectile Master is an interactive browser-based physics game where players solve real-world motion problems using projectile simulations. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it covers projectile motion, bomb drop calculations, and river crossing via engaging visual gameplay with a built-in physics engine.

## 🎮 Game Overview

| Level | Title           | Concepts Covered                                  |
|-------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Basic Projectile | Launch angle, velocity, trajectory, air drag     |
| 2     | Bomb Drop        | Free fall, horizontal motion, impact prediction  |
| 3     | River Crossing   | River currents, vector resolution, relative motion |

Each level is designed to reinforce a different physics formula or principle by letting players experiment with variables and see results in real-time.
